import java.util.*;
public class cube extends Stud
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the side : ");
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        marks(n);
    }
}
class Stud
{
    public static void marks(int n)
    {
        System.out.println("The square value is : "+n*n);
        System.out.println("The cube value is : "+n*n*n);
    }
}
