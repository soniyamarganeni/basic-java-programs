Transportation on vacation
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

      if(d<3)
      {
          cost=d*40;
          return cost;
      }
      else if(d>=3&&d<7)
      {
          cost=(d*40)-20;
          return cost;
      }
      else
      {
          cost=(d*40)-50;
          return cost;
      }
     //write your logic here
  }

public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
int a=sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(rentalCarCost(a));
}}
